        <b>WEEK 5</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>This is my week 5, we started a project in Alice and what I did 
            was a little halloween seen because at the time it was October.
            So what I did was there was this skeleton and pumpkin who met This
            bat but then the bat grew twice its size and started chasing those
            two and scared them away.
